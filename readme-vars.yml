  In order to push files beyond your local gateway you have to make sure port 4001 is forwarded to the internet. This is required for IPFS peers to reach in and grab your files so public gateways can serve them.

  Access the webui at http://localhost , if not using localhost scroll to the bottom of the page and set the API Address setting to IE http://192.168.1.10:5001 , from there you can upload and manage files you push to IPFS. Your gateway to access IPFS files is http://localhost:8080/ipfs/YOUR-FILE-HASH-HERE . You can also simply use public IPFS gateways like: 
  * Cloudflare - https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/YOUR-FILE-HASH-HERE
  * IPFS.io - https://ipfs.io/ipfs/YOUR-FILE-HASH-HERE
  * Eternum.io - https://ipfs.eternum.io/ipfs/YOUR-FILE-HASH-HERE
  
  Cloudflare is a solid option as they actually edge cache the files on their CDN so even if your node pinning the item goes down for periods of time their cache will last up to a month. 
  
  For more on using IPFS please read the docs [here](https://docs.ipfs.io/)
